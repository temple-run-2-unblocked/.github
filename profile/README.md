## **How to Play Temple Run 2**

### ** The Main Goal**
In Temple Run 2, you play as an explorer who’s just stolen a sacred idol from an ancient temple and is now being chased by demonic monkeys. Your mission? Run as far as possible, dodge deadly traps, leap over cliffs, and slide under hazards like spikes, fire traps, ziplines, moving platforms, rivers, and waterfalls.

There’s no final destination — this is an endless journey. The challenge is to survive longer and beat your own high score every run.

### **Controls**

**On Desktop:**
- Move Left/Right: A/D or Left/Right Arrow Keys  
- Jump: W or Up Arrow  
- Slide: S or Down Arrow  

**On Mobile:**
- Move/Turn: Swipe left/right  
- Jump: Swipe up  
- Slide: Swipe down  

It may sound simple, but as the speed increases and obstacles multiply, you'll realize every swipe counts — and a moment's hesitation can mean game over.

## **Collect – Upgrade – Survive**

You're not just running blindly. Along the way, collect coins, gems, and power-ups to unlock new characters, upgrade abilities, and extend your runs. Once you've collected enough coins, you can upgrade key powers like:
- Coin Magnet: Attracts coins automatically
- Shield Duration: Increases protection time
- Boost Distance: Extends your speed boost duration

These upgrades can be game-changers, especially during longer runs when things get intense.

## **Tips for Beginners and Veteran Runners Alike**

- Look ahead, not at your feet: Always keep your eyes a few steps forward to anticipate obstacles.
- Use gems wisely: Don’t waste them on revives early in the run — save them for when you’re breaking records.
- Prioritize key upgrades: Go for survivability first — magnet, shield, and boost will get you farther faster.
- Train your reflexes: At high speed, even a half-second delay can send you flying off a cliff. Stay sharp!
